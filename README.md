Student at the University of Oregon working towards a B.S. in Data Science and minor in Mathematics, with a concentration in Sociology.
I have a passion for cleaning and analyzing real-world data, and designing visualizations to highlight the insights found within.

As an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer, I am eager to apply my knowledge to generate actionable insights and create scalable models.
I look forward to contributing to an innovative company committed to making an impact in the community.
